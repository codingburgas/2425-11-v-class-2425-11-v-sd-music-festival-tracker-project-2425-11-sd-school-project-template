# Example Code for Database Connectivity and Three-Layer Model Structure

Welcome! This repository contains **example code** to help you understand **database connectivity** and the **three-layer model structure** in software development.

### What is this repository for?
This code is designed to **demonstrate** key concepts related to:
- **Database Connectivity**: How to connect your application to a database (Microsoft SQL Server).
- **Three-Layer Architecture**: The separation of your application into three layers:
  1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Handles interactions with the database.
  2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Contains the core logic of the application.
  3. **Presentation Layer (PL)**: Manages user interfaces and interaction.

### Important Notes:
- The code in this repository is **for learning purposes only** and is not intended for real-world use.
- It may be **deleted or changed at any time** without prior notice, so be sure to use it while it's here!
- This is just a simple example to help you understand how these concepts fit together in an application structure.

### Why should I use this?
- If you're learning about software architecture, this repository can give you a **practical example** of how to structure an application.
- It also provides a basic understanding of how different layers in an application work together, especially when connecting to a database.

### How to Use This Code:
1. **Clone or Download**: You can clone or download the repository to explore the code.
2. (Optional) Install Microsoft.SqlClient package from Nuget Package manager
2. **Study the Code**: Look at how the database is connected and how the three-layer model is set up.
3. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code for practice, but remember that this code is not for production use.

### How to Use TODO-To-Issue tracker:
1. In the repo where you want the action to run, go to Settings -> Actions (General) -> Workflow permissions and enable "Read and write permissions".
2. Simply add a line or block comment starting with TODO (or any other comment identifiers configured), followed by a colon and/or space.
3. For more info follow https://github.com/marketplace/actions/todo-to-issue
